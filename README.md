# Integration a chatbot on GLPI
API integration from Vizir to GLPI to build chatbots that create tickets, check ticket status,...

GLPI is an open source tool for managing IT support tickets (incidents, service requests, etc. ...) [https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi]

Published by Teclib Group, a French company that puts responsible innovation at the heart of its values, GLPI has become one of the challengers of the ITSM market in a few years, facing mastondons such as ServiceNow, EasyVista or Jira Service Desk of Atlassian. Indeed, these two aspects (open source and French) have enabled him to establish himself in companies such as La Poste, Airbus, Vinci, Bolloré and La Redoute but also in prestigious public bodies such as the Conseil d'Etat, Inria, the University of Paris 1 Panthéon la Sorbonne and the French National Police.

# Integrations
If you have (or will) opt for GLPI, it is because you want to streamline your IT processes internally. 
And you're to be congratulated for it.

Here are some ideas of how you could interface a chatbot with GLPI:

- Qualify incidents and root incidents to the right team according to subject and urgency, all with natural language
- To carry out research in the documentary base GLPI directly since the chatbot hosted on Teams or on Hangout (or any other support)
- Distill standalone level 0 or level 1 resolution procedures to limit the number of tickets created
- Facilitate the creation of tickets by making it available from your employees' favourite instant messaging tool: avoids hacker solicitation by email / phone / physical mail
